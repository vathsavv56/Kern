LEARNINGS & NOTES
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. BASE PATH PROBLEM (BLANK SCREEN ON VERCEL)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT HAPPENED:
- app worked fine locally but showed blank white screen on vercel
- nothing rendered inside the <div id="root">
- no errors in console, just empty page

WHY IT HAPPENED:
- we had "base: /Kern/" in vite.config.ts
- we had "basename: /Kern/" in react router
- this tells the app: "hey, all my files and routes start with /Kern/"
- github pages puts your app at: username.github.io/Kern/
- so /Kern/ path makes sense for github pages
- BUT vercel puts your app at: your-app.vercel.app/ (no /Kern/)
- so when you visit vercel, the app looks for /Kern/ but its not there
- router finds no matching route = nothing renders = blank screen

HOW TO AVOID:
- use environment variables for base path
- in vite.config.ts: base: process.env.VITE_BASE_URL || "/"
- in router: basename: import.meta.env.BASE_URL
- this way:
  - vercel uses "/" (default)
  - github pages can set VITE_BASE_URL=/Kern/ during build

SIMPLE RULE:
- if deploying to root domain (vercel, netlify) -> base = "/"
- if deploying to sub-path (github pages) -> base = "/repo-name/"
- best practice: make it dynamic with env variables


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. ABSOLUTE POSITIONING BREAKS RESPONSIVE LAYOUTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS ABSOLUTE POSITIONING:
- when you use position: absolute, the element is removed from normal flow
- it floats on top of other elements
- it positions itself based on the nearest "positioned" parent
- if no positioned parent, it uses the whole page

WHY IT BREAKS RESPONSIVE DESIGN:

problem 1: fixed pixel values
- you might write: top: 100px; left: 200px;
- looks good on your screen (maybe 1920px wide)
- on mobile (375px wide), element goes off screen or overlaps other stuff
- pixels dont change when screen size changes

problem 2: element removed from flow
- other elements dont know the absolute element exists
- they dont make space for it
- on small screens, things overlap badly
- on big screens, weird gaps appear

problem 3: parent height collapses
- if all children are absolute, parent has 0 height
- layout breaks completely
- footer might jump to top of page

problem 4: stacking issues
- multiple absolute elements fight for space
- z-index battles begin
- hard to predict what shows on top

HOW TO AVOID:

1. use absolute only when really needed
   - modals and popups
   - tooltips
   - dropdown menus
   - decorative elements (like a badge on a card)

2. prefer flexbox and grid
   - they handle responsive automatically
   - elements stay in flow
   - easier to center things
   - example: instead of absolute centering, use:
     display: flex;
     justify-content: center;
     align-items: center;

3. if you must use absolute, use percentages
   - bad:  left: 200px;
   - good: left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);
   - this centers element regardless of screen size

4. always set position: relative on parent
   - so absolute child positions relative to parent, not page
   - keeps things contained

5. use media queries to adjust
   - @media (max-width: 768px) { top: 10px; }
   - different positions for different screen sizes

6. test on multiple screen sizes early
   - dont wait till end
   - chrome devtools has device toolbar (ctrl+shift+m)
   - test at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px

SIMPLE RULE:
- flexbox/grid = elements know about each other = responsive friendly
- absolute = element is invisible to others = be careful on mobile
